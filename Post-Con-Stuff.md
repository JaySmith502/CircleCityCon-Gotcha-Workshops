**Post-Con Stuff**

I just decided to follow up on a second page as the Readme is already stuffed enough.

The Malware Analysis workshop slides are now in the same folder as the vm's, feel free to download them and use them as you see fit.
If you happen to use them in any workshops or otherwise I'd appreciate a shoutout.

***Update 06/05/18
The Volatility Workshop slides are now uploaded in the same repo as the VM's and the Malware Workshop slides (and I did correct the few typos we noted in class).***

I did correct the Malware sample archive password on the slides.

Reminder if you intend to continue using this VM as a sandbox you'll want to get the missing Wireshark dll online.
When you try to run it, the error box will tell you exactly what you're missing.

Don't forget the contest to win a WiFi Pineapple!  Here's a link outlining the Volatility contest:
