# CircleCityCon-Gotcha!-Workshops 2018

Gotcha! Intro to Malware Analysis Workshop & Intro to Volatile Memory (RAM) Forensics using Volatility Workshop

I'm really looking forward to these quick and dirty Introductions to Malware Analysis and Volatile (RAM) Memory Forensics, suitable for anybody who's comfortable with Virtual Machines, CLI and has an interest in these InfoSec fields for professional development, knowledge or competing in Malware and Volatility centric CTF's.

1.  Download the three files in the following Google Drive directory into the same directory on your computer.  Be patient, this is a 6GB file and will take a little while to download depending on your bandwidth.  This will be posted once I get off this freakin' plane, cuz in-flight wifi is awesome, unless you've enabled 2FA everywhere and your cell phone is a puck.
    
2.  If you're using VirtualBox, you'll want to choose 'File' then 'Import' and search for the .ovf file in the directory where you dropped the files from Dropbox.  Either of these will take around 20 minutes to create a new VM for you.  

3.  If you're using VMWare on a Windows box, you can likely just double-click the .ovf file and VMWare will create the Virtual Machine for you.  You can also just go through the 'File >> New' path using the .vmdk as well.

4.  All necessary files for both workshops are on this desktop, once you login, it wouldn't be a horrible idea to either clone the VM into two or at least snapshot one so you can revert if you plan on attending both workshops.

If you have any issues please reach out to me prior to CircleCityCon so we can get you ready to go.


I'm not going to release the password to the Archives on the desktop until the workshop to ensure nobody self-pwns by getting too curious and working ahead (speaking as a notorious self-pwner).

Thank you so much for attending these workshops, it means a lot to me and I promise I'll do everything I can to ensure this is a great learning experience for all of us.
