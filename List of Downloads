In case you are unable to extract the .ovf (this is a finicky process for sure), here's a list of what we'll be needing for the workshop.

1.  A Windows 7 Virtual Machine (you can get a 90 day trial .iso at modern.ie)
2.  The following programs installed on your virtual machine, with appropriate paths lined up to execute in your Desktop
    -PEStudio:                                                  https://winitor.com/binaries.html
    -CFF Explorer (x86 Version, stand-alone, Zip Archive):      http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php
    -Wireshark (install WinPCAP as well):                       https://www.wireshark.org/#download
    -ComputeHash:                                               http://www.subisoft.net/computehash.aspx
    -ApateDNS                                                   https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Mandiant-ApateDNS
    -ExeInfoPE                                                  http://exeinfo.atwebpages.com/
    -WinRAR                                                     https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm
    -ProcessHacker                                              https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/downloads.php
    -SysInternals Suite                                         https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite
3.  I'll bring the sample archives to CircleCityCon on a few USB's for anybody that has to use this method.  It would be more efficient if you're able to get the VM working, just sayin'.

   
If you have any troubles with this method or any of these downloads please reach out, I have all of these in hand and can help wherever I can.

Thanks and I look forward to seeing you at CircleCityCon!
